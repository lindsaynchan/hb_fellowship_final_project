# TV Now

The shift towards watching television in non-traditional ways as well as the increase of available shows and content providers have made it harder for people to find and watch television shows that they are interested in. TV Now is a full stack web application that brings together multiple television data sources so users don't have to. Users can find and save their favorite television shows, access information about shows and locate when and where to watch them.
